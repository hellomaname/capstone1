        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> Hello there my name is Jack and I am currently 19 years old. Since I can remember my favorite passion has always been technology
            whether that be building computers or selling them, I have always known that I have wanted to persue a career in the tech industry
            which is what lead me to web development.</p>
        
        <p>I first discovered web development, and the potential which it brings, earlier this year and I instantly fell in love. The ability 
            to create something so advanced that it can take days to code just one page fascinated me and I wanted to know more, which is where I found 
            Dr. Angela Yu's course. This bootcamp has only made my interest grow and I now know that this is what I want to do in my life, in particular 
            freelance web development.</p>

        <p>I can't gurantee much in this life, but what I can gurantee is that I will put everything I have into every line of code I type and into every 
            website I create. What's the good of working if you can't take pride in it?</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Next PLC</h3>
    <h4>July 2021 - April 2022 </h4>
    <p>
        In my initial role at NEXT, I gained valuable experience in customer service, honed my time management skills, and developed strong communication abilities. 
        These foundational skills were instrumental in my journey to my current position. 
        I recognized my desire to contribute significantly to profitability, which motivated me to transition to a sales-oriented role.
    </p>
    <p> My time at NEXT provided me with a solid foundation in the essential skills required for a successful career in web development. 
        It has allowed me to understand the critical importance of customer interactions, time management, and effective communication. 
        My decision to pursue a sales position was driven by my aspiration to have a more direct and positive impact on enhancing profitability for the organization.
        This experience has further fuelled my passion for data-driven decision-making and problem-solving, making me well-prepared for the role of a web developer.

     <br />
     <h3>Currys PLC</h3>
     <h4>April 2022 - Present</h4>
    <p> During my near two year time at Currys, I have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to excellence, driven by my innate competitiveness and a remarkable ability to rapidly acquire new skills. 
        These qualities have not only enabled me to consistently surpass my sales targets but have also earned me the distinction of being the top-performing salesperson on multiple occasions.
    </p>
    <p> At just 18 years old, I believe my age can be leveraged as a significant asset. My youth brings a unique advantage as it allows me to adapt my skills to the ever-evolving digital landscape. 
        I am eager to apply my adaptable and analytical mindset to a web development position, where I can harness my determination and competitive spirit to drive insightful, creative and effective decisions.
